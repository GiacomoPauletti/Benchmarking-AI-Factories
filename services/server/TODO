DOCS:
- Create diagram showcasing CI (testing) pipeline. Add this to the docs. Explain that GitHub Actions Or Gitlab could be used, but that we do it manually for now.
- Create architecture diagram for server service. Add to docs.
- Document vec-db and vllm example python workflow script: Link to them in the docs.

MAIN:
- Create vec-db examples with documents.  
- Analyse monitoring class (scraper for server) and query vllm metric endpoint (need to
create that endpoint on vllm container?)
- Fix qdrant endpoint not resolving. Then fix embedding in examples. Then possibly create RAG?
- SSHManager class to global utils?
- Test multi-node vllm.

Optional:
- Create RAG automatically on the vllm and vec-db sides (not on client or server).
- Fix RAG augmented example.
- Create proper CI pipeline with actions: 
    - build: docker image with python code, etc.. is built. 
    - test: docker image is passed into test environment. Runs and must pass specific tests.
- Create HF auth mechanism.



Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec

vector-db: 
- recall
- latency to retrieve chunks of text or vectors
- example datasets from huggingface
