DOCS:
- Create diagram showcasing CI (testing) pipeline. Add this to the docs. Explain that GitHub Actions Or Gitlab could be used, but that we do it manually for now.
- Create architecture diagram for server service. Add to docs.
OTHER:
- Test multi-node vllm.
- Create vec-db examples with documents. Document these examples.
- In services, create base classes for inference and for vectordb. The vllm and qdrant 
services should subclass them.
- Create HF auth mechanism.



Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec

vector-db: 
- recall
- latency to retrieve chunks of text or vectors
- example datasets from huggingface
