DOCS:

MAIN:
- Orchestration manager should not be inside the service_orchestration folder?
- Adapt the testing scripts to the new orchestrator system.
- Delete all files in meluxina. Then restart server to see if everything works smoothly.
- Find a smarter way to proxy to the orchestrator. 
(Is there a smarter, more dynamic way of proxying the orchestrator 
from the server? Rather than hardcoding everything?)

Optional:
- Create fastembed functionality in qdrant. Use it for RAGs using HF datasets.
- Create proper CI pipeline with actions: 
    - build: docker image with python code, etc.. is built. 
    - test: docker image is passed into test environment. Runs and must pass specific tests.


Things to Benchmark:

- names of models currently loaded

vector-db: 
- example datasets from huggingface
- queries per second 
- latency per vector search
- time to build or update index
- number of loaded collections 
- recall ()
