- Create API docs (autogenerated by FastAPI). Complement with more elaborate docs.
- Add more unit and integrations tests.
- Simplify _create_script and refactor it into understandable pieces. 
- Status of services should show that an image is building or initializing.
- Improve vllm model management (choosing model). Maybe in yaml file? Maybe specify it with prompt?




Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec

vector-db: 
- recall
- latency to retrieve chunks of text or vectors
- example datasets from huggingface
