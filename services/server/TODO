DOCS:
- Create diagram showcasing CI (testing) pipeline. Add this to the docs.
OTHER:
- Test multi-node vllm.
- Create HF auth mechanism.
- Separate vllm and vec-db logic from slurm deployer logic? 
Create deployment folder with one module for slurm, another for vllm, another for vec-db. Way to make code more elegant (abstract classes)?
- Test vec-db.

Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec

vector-db: 
- recall
- latency to retrieve chunks of text or vectors
- example datasets from huggingface
