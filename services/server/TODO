DOCS:

MAIN:
- Add more unit/api tests to orchestrator. 
- Organize docs and add more details about architecture, orchestrator design decision.
- Delete all files in meluxina. Then restart server to see if everything works smoothly.

Optional:
- VLLMEndpoint, LoadBalancer, register/unregister, forward_completion, and health checking are vllm_service specific. Refactor?
- Create fastembed functionality in qdrant. Use it for RAGs using HF datasets.
- Create proper CI pipeline with actions: 
    - build: docker image with python code, etc.. is built. 
    - test: docker image is passed into test environment. Runs and must pass specific tests.


Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec
- uptime seconds
- process memory usage 
- number of models currently loaded
- names of models currently loaded

vector-db: 
- example datasets from huggingface
- queries per second 
- latency per vector search
- time to build or update index
- number of loaded collections 
- recall ()
