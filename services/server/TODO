DOCS:

MAIN:
- Make log and status syncing/caching faster such that ssh tunnels with high latency (e.g. SLURM) do not time out.
- Make Server API handle more than one request at a time (currently blocking). 
- Check if correct error codes are being returned when prompting (200 vs 503)

Optional:
- Create fastembed functionality in qdrant. Use it for RAGs using HF datasets.
- Create proper CI pipeline with actions: 
    - build: docker image with python code, etc.. is built. 
    - test: docker image is passed into test environment. Runs and must pass specific tests.


Things to Benchmark:
vllm:
- tokens/sec
- uptime seconds
- process memory usage 
- number of models currently loaded
- names of models currently loaded

vector-db: 
- example datasets from huggingface
- queries per second 
- latency per vector search
- time to build or update index
- number of loaded collections 
- recall ()
