Server:
    MAIN:
        - Create fastembed functionality in qdrant. Use it for RAGs using HF datasets.

    Things to Benchmark:
    vector-db: 
        - example datasets from huggingface
        - queries per second 
        - latency per vector search
        - time to build or update index
        - number of loaded collections 
        - recall ()


Client:
    MAIN:
    - Add possibility of using big prompt datasets and RAGs using the vec-db service.

Grafana:

Overall:
- Make everything production-ready (release tag), update docs, host them on github (make it public). 
- As soon as the code is production-ready, 
    create a youtube video showcasing the project and its functionalities.
    Then update the docs and create the report.
- If there is time and energy, create qdrant functionalities for fastembed and RAGs using HF datasets.
