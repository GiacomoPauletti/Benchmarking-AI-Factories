# Microservices Development Guide

## AI Benchmarking Application - Team Reference

### Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns one capability
1. **Decoupled Communication**: Services communicate via well-defined APIs
1. **Data Independence**: Each service manages its own database/storage
1. **Failure Isolation**: Service failures donâ€™t cascade to others
1. **Technology Agnostic**: Choose the best tech stack for each service

### Development Workflow

#### Git Strategy

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/service-name/feature-description`
- **Pull Requests**: Require code review + automated tests
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable, protected

#### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Build**: Docker image creation and testing
1. **Test**: Unit tests, integration tests
1. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to dev/staging/prod

### Team Collaboration

#### Service Ownership

- Each team member owns one primary service
- Cross-training sessions for knowledge sharing
- Shared responsibility for integration testing

#### Communication

- APIs documented and versioned
- Regular architecture reviews and dependency mapping
- Incident response procedures for service failures

**Remember**: Start simple, iterate fast, and maintain service boundaries. Focus on getting the basics right before optimizing.
